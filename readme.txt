We have selected the mysql database as the database for the backend our reasons are:
1) MySql database has a well-defined data structure, with tables and columns, which makes it easier to organize and manage data.
2) MySql database have built-in mechanisms for maintaining data integrity, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, which help to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data. 
3) MySql database support transactions, which allow multiple operations to be performed as a single, atomic unit of work. This makes it possible to roll back changes if an error occurs, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the data.
4) And the team members of the group have better experience dealing with relational databases than document databases
